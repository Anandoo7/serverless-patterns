      "This sample project demonstrates how to use a Java-based Lambda function to resize an image from source bucket and put the resized image in a destination bucket.",
      "When a new JPEG image is added to the source S3 bucket, an event gets triggered which in turn invoked the Java-based Lambda function. The Lambda functions gets the object from the bucket, resizes it to 800x600 resolution, and finally puts the resized image in the destination bucket.",
      "This pattern uses AWS SAM with Lambda SnapStart on ARM64 architecture on a Java 21 manged runtime."
