      "Whenever there is a change (insert, update, or delete) to an item in a DynamoDB table, a new record is added to the DynamoDB Stream. The stream captures the details of the event and the item data.",
      "This architecture allows you to react to changes in your DynamoDB table by filtering (optional) and delivering relevant events to an SQS queue. The EventBridge Pipe acts as a bridge between the DynamoDB Stream and the SQS queue.",
      "Other services or applications can then consume these events from the SQS queue for further processing or integration with other systems."
